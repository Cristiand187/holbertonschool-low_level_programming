## Task

### [0. Multiple mains](./0-main.c)
In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a postitive_or_negative() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project:


### [1. Like, comment, subscribe](./1-main.c)
Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
 * Don’t add or remove any lines of code, as we will be checking your line count. You are only allowed to comment out existing code.
 * You do not have to compile with 
Wall 
Werror 
Wextra 
pedantic for this task.


### [2. 0 > 972?](./2-largest_number.c)
This program prints the largest of three integers.


### [3. Leap year](./3-print_remaining_days.c)
This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.
